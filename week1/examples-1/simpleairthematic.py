'''
This is the programe that takes two predefined input variables
do the basic mathematic operation and show the output in the console
'''
# assigns the value 10 to variable a
# the datatype is defined in the basis of input provided by itself
a = 10 
b = 20

c = a+b # airthematic addition
d= a*b # airthematic multiplication
e = a/b #division
f = b-a #subtraction

print("sum = {addition}, product = {product}, division = {division}, subtraction = {subtraction}".format(addition=c, product=d, division=e,subtraction=f))
