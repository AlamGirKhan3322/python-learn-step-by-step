**Why Python ?**

 1. Top 5 most popular language and growing rapidly
 2. Can be used to create websites
 3. Predicting stocks machine learning (using sci-kit)
 4. Data analysis using Pandas
 5. Game Development (PyGame)

> It was a Dutch programmer, Guido Van Rossum, who wrote Python as a hobby programming project back in the late 1980s. Since then it has grown to become one of the most polished languages of the computing world.

Installation

> Recommended to install anaconda from the official website
> https://anaconda.org/
> Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

**Lets begin with **

    print("hello world")

> Python code can be typed and run directly from the console step by step or can be run from the file. The file extension of the python is *.py

**More (Python as a calculator )**

> **Addition and subtraction**
> 
> print(5 + 5)
> print(5 - 5)

> Multiplication and division
> print(3 * 5)
> print(10 / 2)

> Exponentiation
> print(4 ** 2)

> Modulo
> print(18 % 7)

> How much is your $100 worth after 7 years (assume interest is 10% per annum) ?

**Tips**
> Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as: 
> **Exponentiation:** This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
> **Modulo:** % This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.
